# 📊 Campaign Analytics: Regression & Correlation Insights
**Focus Areas**: Marketing Strategy Optimization | Linear Regression | ROI Analysis

**Tech Stack**: Python (Jupyter Notebook), pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Project Overview

This project explores how different marketing strategies influence sales revenue across various hospital account types—small, medium, and large. By applying data analytics and machine learning techniques (primarily linear regression and correlation analysis), it identifies high-impact channels and provides actionable insights for boosting ROI.

✅ **Objectives**

* Analyze the impact of marketing tactics (e.g., calls, emails, flyers, sales visits) on revenue.

* Investigate how strategy effectiveness varies across hospital sizes.

* Develop a regression-based ROI model to support strategic decision-making.

🧹 **Key Steps**

* Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, anomalies, and outliers for accurate analysis.

* Feature Engineering: Created and refined features to improve model performance.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered patterns and channel effectiveness across segments.

* Modeling & Insights: Built linear regression models to rank marketing channels by ROI.

**💡 Insights**

* Direct Sales Visits emerged as the most impactful tactic across all account types.

* Flyers also contributed significantly to revenue generation.

* Synergies between channels (e.g., flyers + visits) may hold potential for amplified ROI.

**📈 Deliverables**

* Cleaned and engineered dataset.

* Visualized EDA findings and channel-wise sales impact.

* ROI summary table to guide future campaign investments.
